# Domain of Attraction (DOA) Estimate using Finite-Time Lyapunov Functions (FTLF)

To get started check out the file `toggle_DOA.m`. This MATLAB script estimates the domain of attraction for a toggle switch dynamical model. It analytically computes Lyapunov functions for all equilibrium points to compute the DOA. The Lyapunov functions are analytically constructed using the FTLF theory as described in the paper below. 
This code generates all of the figures in the following paper:
